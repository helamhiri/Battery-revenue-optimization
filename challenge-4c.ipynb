    "# Introduction to QAOA\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to optimization problems, a well-known algorithm for finding approximate solutions to combinatorial-optimization problems is **QAOA (Quantum approximate optimization algorithm)**. You may have already used it once in the finance exercise of Challenge-1, but still don't know what it is. In this challlenge we will further learn about QAOA----how does it work? Why we need it?\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, what is QAOA?  Simply put, QAOA is a classical-quantum  hybrid algorithm that combines a parametrized quantum circuit known as ansatz, and a classical part to optimize those circuits proposed by Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann (2014)[**[1]**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028). \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a variational algorithm that uses a unitary $U(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\boldsymbol{\\gamma})$ characterized by the parameters $(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\boldsymbol{\\gamma})$ to prepare a quantum state $|\\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\boldsymbol{\\gamma})\\rangle$. The goal of the algorithm is to find optimal parameters $(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{opt}, \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{opt})$ such that the quantum state $|\\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{opt}, \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{opt})\\rangle$ encodes the solution to the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "The unitary $U(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\boldsymbol{\\gamma})$ has a specific form and is composed of two unitaries $U(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = e^{-i \\boldsymbol{\\beta} H_B}$ and $U(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}) = e^{-i \\boldsymbol{\\gamma} H_P}$ where $H_{B}$ is the mixing Hamiltonian and $H_{P}$ is the problem Hamiltonian. Such a choice of unitary drives its inspiration from a related scheme called quantum annealing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state is prepared by applying these unitaries as alternating blocks of the two unitaries applied $p$ times such that \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lvert \\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}) \\rangle = \\underbrace{U(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) U(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}) \n",

    "Battery storage systems have provided a solution to flexibly integrate large-scale renewable energy (such as wind and solar) in a power system. The revenues from batteries come from different types of services sold to the grid. The process of energy trading of battery storage assets is as follows: A regulator asks each battery supplier to choose a market in advance for each time window. Then, the batteries operator will charge the battery with renewable energy and release the energy to the grid depending on pre-agreed contracts. The supplier makes therefore forecasts on the return and the number of charge/discharge cycles for each time window to optimize its overall return. \n",
    "\n",
    "How to maximize the revenue of battery-based energy storage is a concern of all battery storage investors. Choose to let the battery always supply power to the market which pays the most for every time window might be a simple guess, but in reality, we have to consider many other factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "What we can not ignore is the aging of batteries, also known as **degradation**. As the battery charge/discharge cycle progresses, the battery capacity will gradually degrade (the amount of energy a battery can store, or the amount of power it can deliver will permanently reduce). After a number of cycles, the battery will reach the end of its usefulness. Since the performance of a battery decreases while it is used, choosing the best cash return for every time window one after the other, without considering the degradation, does not lead to an optimal return over the lifetime of the battery, i.e. before the number of charge/discharge cycles reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in order to optimize the revenue of the battery, what we have to do is to select the market for the battery in each time window taking both **the returns on these markets (value)**, based on price forecast, as well as expected battery **degradation over time (cost)** into account ——It sounds like solving a common optimization problem, right?\n",

    "QAOA was developed with inspiration from adiabatic quantum computation. In adiabatic quantum computation, based on the quantum adiabatic theorem, the ground state of a given Hamiltonian can ideally be obtained. Therefore, by mapping the optimization problem to this Hamiltonian, it is possible to solve the optimization problem with adiabatic quantum computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the computational equivalence of adiabatic quantum computation and quantum circuits has been shown, simulating adiabatic quantum computation on quantum circuits involves a large number of gate operations, which is difficult to achieve with current noisy devices. QAOA solves this problem by using a quantum-classical hybrid approach.\n",

    "The next section contains an implementation of a quantum circuit that solves an optimization problem without classical optimization, based on this adiabatic quantum computation framework. In other words, the circuit you build is expected to give a good approximate solution in a single run.\n",

    "1. In the first step, the precision of output of your quantum circuit is checked.\n",
    "To pass this step, your circuit should output a probability distribution whose **average precision is more than 0.80** for eight instances; four of them are fixed data, while the remaining four are randomly selected data from multiple datasets.\n",
    "If your circuit cannot satisfy this threshold **0.8**, you will not obtain a score.\n",
    "We will explain how the precision of a probability distribution will be calculated when the submitted quantum circuit solves one instance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. This precision evaluates how the values of measured feasible solutions are close to the value of optimal solutions.\n",
    "    2. Firstly the number of measured feasible solutions is very low, the precision will be 0 (Please check **\"The number of feasible solutions\"** below). <br>Before calculating precision, the values of solutions will be normalized so that the precision of the solution whose value is the lowest would be always 0 by subtracting the lowest value.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Let $N_s$, $N_f$, and $\\lambda_{opt}$ be the total shots (the number of execution), the shots of measured feasible solutions, the optimial solution value. Also let $R(x)$ and $C(x)$ be value and cost of a solution $x\\in\\{0,1\\}^n$ respectively. We normalize the values by subtracting the lowest value of instance, which can be calculated by the summation of $\\lambda_{1}$.\n",
    "    Given a probability distribution, the precision is computed with the following formula:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    \\text{precision} = \\frac 1 {N_f\\cdot (\\lambda_{opt}-\\mathrm{sum}(\\lambda_{1}) )} \\sum_{x, \\text{$\\mathrm{shots}_x$}\\in \\text{ prob.dist.}} (R(x)-\\mathrm{sum}(\\lambda_{1})) \\cdot \\text{$\\mathrm{shots}_x$} \\cdot 1_{C(x) \\leq C_{max}}\n",

    "    Here, $\\mathrm{shots}_x$ is the counts of measuring the solution $x$. For example, given a probability distribution {\"1000101\": 26, \"1000110\": 35, \"1000111\": 12, \"1001000\": 16, \"1001001\": 11} with shots $N_s = 100$,\n",

So, the shots of measured feasbile solutions $N_f$ is calculated as $N_f = 26+12+11=49$. And the lowest value is $ \\mathrm{sum}(\\lambda_{1}) = 5+3+3+6+9+7+1=34$. \n",
